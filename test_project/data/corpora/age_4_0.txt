1782775	no
1782776	the people will be standing up straight won't they
1782778	NA

1794991	no
1794992	right
1794993	this one next
1794994	the flowery one
1794996	I think this should still fit you this one
1794997	because I think we only got this towards the end of last year
1794998	let's have a look
1794999	turn round
1795001	right
1795002	how does that feel
1795003	lift your arms up
1795004	is it not too tight
1795006	well there you go
1795007	another summer dress
1795009	yeah
1795010	not as big as the other one
1795011	but it does do good ones
1795012	ah that looks nice
1795014	see
1795015	all these dresses look really nice with your jeans
1795016	cause do you know some people wear jeans and dresses at the same time you know
1795018	and it looks
1795019	yeah
1795020	you know when it's not very hot
1795021	but you want to wear your nice dress
1795022	you can wear it over your jeans
1795023	cause that looks really nice on you
1795024	with your with your jeans on
1795028	try the next one
1795030	that pink one I think is gonna be too small for you
1795032	I think it's gonna be too small
1795035	do you not think so
1795036	I think it's too small this one definitely
1795038	let's give it a go
1795039	arms in
1795040	arms up
1795042	is it not
1795043	how does it feel
1795045	does it
1795047	ooh maybe that's not too small either then
1795048	cause you're a very tall girl I think
1795049	makes me wonder if they're gonna fit you
1795050	but when you put them on they do fit you don't they
1795051	they look lovely with jeans as well
1795052	that's what I think you can wear this weekend
1795053	you can wear jeans and dresses
1795054	what do you think
1795057	I know
1795058	because I think you're a bit tired
1795059	come here
1795061	??? cause you've had some medicine
1795063	not not hot any more are you

1795065	it's a good job that we gave you all that medicine
1795066	you know why
1795067	cause I think it nipped it in the bud
1795068	I think you might be alright
1795069	I think tomorrow this virus won't get any worse
1795071	so I don't know if we're gonna need to buy you any more summer dresses this year
1795072	cause it looks like all your ones are gonna fit you from last year
1795073	let's try this one
1795074	oh I don't know if this one will actually
1795075	this looks too small
1795077	but I said that about the last one and that fit you didn't it

1795080	and this one looks like it does big twirls this one

1795222	you can't be getting changed too many times every day darling

1795259	and there's always clothes in your bedroom cause you keep getting them out the wardrobe
1795260	and putting them on for five minutes and making them messy
1795261	if you put some clothes on you wear them all day
1795262	you can't keep getting changed all the time

1821110	okay
1821112	yeah
1821114	now what do we want to put on there
1821115	I mean do you think you'll be able to put these tiny little beads on
1821116	do you think that'll be too tricky
1821118	um
1821119	I don't know if I'd be able to do that actually
1821121	these are nice
1821122	do you want these things
1821124	these these beads and these beads
1821126	all the big beads cause we know they'll go on don't we
1821130	shiny aren't they
1821132	oh
1821133	these ones
1821136	right
1821137	let me put a knot in one end for ya
1821139	just so that all your beads when you put them on they don't all come off
1821140	are you awake Gina
1821141	cause you know what they'll do
1821142	once you slide it on
1821143	it'll come right off at the other end when it gets there
1821144	unless you've got a knot in it
1821146	there you go
1821147	mix em all up
1821148	that's it
1821149	and then one different one next to another different one
1821150	okay
1821151	let me just get the string
1821152	ooh
1821153	where's the clasps
1821154	keep it
1821155	keep them safe
1821157	catches
1821158	yeah
1821165	maybe it's underneath all the beads
1821172	okay
1821173	give me a minute and I'll sort it out
1821174	catch on
1821177	because it's a bit tricky
1821179	there we go
1821182	they won't come off now when you thread them on
1821185	all your stuff won't come off now
1821186	you know when you thread it on
1821187	it'll stay on
1821188	cause it's secure now
1821189	that clasp will stop it all falling off
1821190	now when you're done I'll chop that bit so it looks neater
1821191	so that's what you do
1821192	you put em through there
1821193	can you manage it
1821195	okay
1821197	can you do it
1821199	do you know what I might need to do
1821201	shall I just sort this end bit out then it'll be easier for you to put them on
1821202	let's chop all the fluffy bit off
1821206	because then it'll be easier to thread stuff on
1821207	cause if it's got fuzzy bits you might not be able to do it
1821217	no
1821219	it's nice and hard at the end now so you'll be able to go
1821220	pop it on like that
1821221	push it through
1821222	a bit tricky
1821225	hiccup queen
1821227	there you go

1821230	put whichever ones you want on
1821231	is that enough beads do you think or do you want some more
1821233	look at those bits there
1821235	mm
1821237	I think that they're too small

1823221	well it's not about what you want to do
1823222	if Grandma

1823242	now when Grandma and Nanny want to get out the car and do stuff
1823243	you don't sit there and say no you're not getting out the car
1823244	how dare you do that
1823245	really really naughty
1823246	it's really upset me that has
1823247	cause Papi's at home
1823248	he can't even go out of the house
1823249	and Nanny looks after him all the time
1823250	and then when Nanny wants to go to the shops
1823251	just for one hour
1823252	to get out of the house
1823253	and see people
1823254	and have a walk around
1823255	you spoil it
1823256	I feel that's awful

1823275	I was about to say
1823276	when you see Nanny next
1823277	yeah
1823278	you best say Nanny I'm really sorry for spoiling your day
1823279	cause that was the only day you get to go out of the house
1823280	and I spoiled it
1823281	say I'm very very sorry
1823282	are you sorry

1823292	and you can say
1823293	Nanny I'm really sorry for being horrible the other day

1823295	yeah
1823297	we'll phone her and tell her
1823298	cause I didn't even know you'd been naughty
1823299	cause they didn't tell me
1823300	you've got to try Gina
1823301	not to spoil people's days
1823302	and not to just think about yourself
1823303	do you know who's the most important person for us to think about
1823305	Nanny and Grandma
1823306	cause we've got to make them happy haven't we
1823308	cause Nanny never gets out the house
1823309	cause she's looking after Papi
1823310	so when she does come out with us
1823311	even if it's just for an hour
1823312	we have to make it a really nice day for her
1823313	don't we
1823314	do you think you can do that next time
1823316	I hope so

1823326	and I am so happy
1823327	I want them to say that
1823328	instead of saying
1823329	oh she was very naughty
1823330	we're very sad
1823331	she's really spoilt the day
1823332	which is better

1823654	if we wanted to take that with us if they were knocking this house down
1823655	we could take that away
1823656	and then let them knock the house down

1828053	then we put them away
1828056	???
1828060	you shouldn't do that because if you don't wrap them up properly biscuits go all dry and then you can't eat them
1828061	that'd be no good
1828062	if you went to have one of them in your school packed lunch
1828063	and they'd all gone off
1828064	cause they weren't wrapped up properly
1828065	right
1828066	so that's all our vegetables in there

2002603	right
2002604	this is poor Henry has broken down
2002605	the troublesome trucks have pushed him off the track
2002606	the fat controller says that Diesel will take Henry's place while he's being repaired
2002607	so that means that he needs to be fixed
2002608	when the fat controller sees how good I am he'll get rid of steam engines once and for all Diesel says to the troublesome trucks
2002610	that's Diesel there
2002611	and those two
2002612	they are the troublesome trucks

2002638	the trucks laugh and laugh
2002640	because he's fallen over
2002642	cause he he was being um silly thinking he was the worlds strongest engine
2002643	Henry arrives back at the docks
2002644	he has been repaired
2002645	he's coupled to the trucks and the shunters release the brakes
2002646	Henry pulls away as easy as pie and all the engines cheer

2030301	okay
2030302	this is called Primrose's picture
2030303	it was Primrose's birthday and she was determined to make it as special as she could
2030304	I simply must have my portrait painted she declared
2030305	so it's Primrose's birthday isn't it and she wants her picture done
2030306	oh yes agreed Violet
2030307	I'd love to paint you
2030308	it could be your birthday present
2030309	so it was all agreed
2030310	Primrose sat in the corner next to a vase of bright roses and Violet fetcher her easels and paints
2030311	do you remember that magnet that you've got
2030313	that's that's the that's called the easel
2030315	so when you put the paper on you put your paper on an easel
2030316	Primrose had to sit still while Violet painted away with great care making her picture look just like Primrose
2030318	yes darling
2030320	er no
2030321	maybe well maybe she's not finished it yet
2030322	maybe she's gonna do a flower in a minute
2030323	cause she's not finished doing her body yet either
2030324	and she's only done one rose hasn't she
2030325	after a while Primrose jumped up
2030326	oh dear I've just remembered that I promised to have a special birthday tea with Fifi said Primrose
2030327	off you go smiled Violet
2030328	I'll just finish the flowers and vase while you're having tea
2030329	then you can see the painting later when it's finished
2030330	Violet had just put the finishing touches on the painting when Slugsy dropped by
2030331	oh that's beautiful he said
2030332	then he looked a bit sad
2030333	why can't I have my picture painted Violet he asked
2030334	is it because I'm a horrible slimy slug
2030335	Violet felt sorry for Slugsy so she put Primrose's portrait to one side and started to paint Slugsy's picture right away
2030337	when it
2030338	because Slugsy was sad wasn't he because he didn't think anyone wanted t t to paint a picture of him cause he thought nobody liked him because he was a slimy slug
2030339	and Violet felt sorry for him so she did a painting of him
2030340	when it was finished Violet put it on her easel and left it to dry
2030341	just then Primrose came back
2030342	she rushed over to Violet's easel to look at her finished portrait
2030343	she couldn't believe her eyes
2030344	oh Violet she wailed it's horrible
2030345	I look just like a slug
2030346	how could you possibly be so mean
2030347	Violet just laughed
2030348	this isn't a painting of you she said
2030349	this is portrait of dear old Slugsy
2030350	Primose looked at the painting again
2030351	so it is she said cheering up straight away
2030352	you clever thing
2030353	it looks just like him
2030354	Violet handed Primrose her birthday portrait and she was delighted
2030355	she went off to hang it up and admire herself
2030356	Slugsy took his own picture and to Violet's surprise he was grinning too
2030357	I hope Primrose didn't hurt your feelings Slugsy said Violet
2030358	not at all he replied
2030359	I'm so happy Primrose says it looks just like me
2030360	Slugsy slimed home and happily hung up his new portrait

2031081	that's it
2031082	when he spots a yummy treat like chocolate cake for him to eat he thinks up a naughty plot so he can gobble up the lot

2038097	can be a big barn now can't it
2038099	yeah
2038101	mhm hm
2038103	does that chicken move or anything

2038118	no
2038120	what's underneath the cow
