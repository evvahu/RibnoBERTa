2134838	once upon a time there was a lovely young girl who lived with her widowed father
2134839	she was happy and kind to all
2134840	however her father felt like she needed a mother and in time he married a woman with two young daughters of her own
2134841	when her dear father died the young girl soon learned the true nature of her cruel stepmother and stepsisters
2134842	they called her Cinderella and forced her to do all the work of the household
2134843	she sang as she cooked and cleaned and never complained about her hard life
2134844	Cinderella dreamed that some day the wishes dear to her heart would come true and she would find true love and happiness
2134845	the barnyard animals became her companions and she was so gentle that even the birds and mice did not fear her
2134846	Gus and Jack were two mice that Cinderella fed and dressed
2134847	they loved her dearly and wished they could do something to help her
2134848	those are her two friends there
2134850	Gus and Jack
2134852	I don't know which one's which
2134853	look at them there
2134855	they helping her feed the chickens or are they eating the chickens food do you think
2134858	oh I see
2134859	one day an invitation arrived from the royal palace
2134860	there's to be a ball the stepmother read
2134861	every eligible maiden is to attend
2134862	well I can go too Cinderella cried
2134863	her stepmother agreed if Cinderella managed to finish her work
2134864	Gus and Jack and the other mice and friends decided to surprise Cinderella
2134865	they sewed a lovely gown while she worked at her chores
2134866	Cinderella was overjoyed to find the beautiful dress in her attic room
2134867	she put it on and rushed to join her stepsisters
2134868	that's very pretty isn't it
2134870	pink and white
2134871	look that's my sash cried one in a jealous rage
2134872	those are my beads shrieked the other
2134873	they tore up Cinderella's dress until it was tattered and ruined
2134874	poor Cinderella ran to the garden in despair
2134875	ah that's not very nice is it
2134877	her the evil stepsisters ripped Cinderella's dress
2134879	that's not very nice is it
2134881	as she wept Cinderella became aware of a gentle hand stroking her hair and a soft voice speaking to her
2134882	who are you Cinderella asked the kindly woman
2134883	why I'm your fairy god mother child the woman said
2134884	I've come to help you get to the ball
2134885	then with a wave of her wand the mice changed into horses and a pumpkin became a glittering coach
2134886	Cinderella was speechless
2134887	with another wave of her wand the fairy god mother changed her Cinderella's raggedy dress to a beautiful shimmering gown
2134888	Cinderella looked down she was even wearing sparkling glass slippers
2134890	you must leave the ball before midnight the fairy god mother told her for then the spell will be broken
2134891	as soon as Cinderella entered the ball room the prince could not take his eyes off her
2134892	they danced under the light of the moon and before long they had fallen in love
2134893	suddenly a chime sounded from above
2134894	the clock had begun to strike the midnight hour
2134895	I must go Cinderella cried as she ran from the ballroom
2134896	in her hurry one glass shoe slipped from her foot
2134897	the prince picked up the delicate slipper
2134898	I will marry the maiden whose foot fits this slipper he declared
2134899	turn the page
2134900	the grand duke and his footmen set out at dawn to find the owner of the glass slipper
2134901	in time they came to Cinderella's house and were relieved to see that the slipper fit neither of the unpleasant stepsisters
2134902	what the grand duke did not know was that Cinderella had been locked away in the attic by her evil stepmother
2134903	she's not very nice is she
2134905	she's locked Cinderella
2134907	yeah
2134908	I'm not finished yet
2134909	hold on
2134910	Gus and Jack bravely stole the key and slid it under the door to free Cinderella just in time
2134911	just as the grand duke and his footmen were preparing to leave with the slipper Cinderella called him
2134912	your Grace please wait
2134913	may I try it on
2134914	the wicked stepmother sneered but there was nothing she could do
2134915	or was there
2134916	just as the footmen passed her she tripped him with her cane
2134917	the glass slipper flew from her hands and shattered at Cinderella's feet
2134918	the Grand Duke gasped in dismay just as Cinderella spoke
2134919	but you see I have the other slipper
2134920	she held out the matching shoe to the delight of the grand duke and the horror of her stepmother
2134921	it fit her foot perfectly
2134922	Cinderella's dream had come true
2134923	the prince and Cinderella were married right away and they lived happily ever

2134966	Snow_White lived in the castle of the cruel and jealous queen
2134967	the queen began each day by asking her magic mirror to tell her the name of the fairest maiden in all the land
2134968	on the day the mirror replied Snow_White the queen decided that the beautiful young princess must die
2134969	the queen summoned her huntsman and ordered him to take the young girls life
2134970	the huntsman however was a good man and he couldn't bring himself to kill the beautiful princess
2134971	he fell to his knees and revealed the wicked plot to Snow_White

2139714	you'll never find your bananas now said Swiper laughing
2139715	well that's not very nice is it
2139717	yeah
2139718	he thinks it's funny doesn't he
2139720	the Super_babies wanted to get their baby banana food back
2139721	to get to the bananas Map said we had to go through the
2139723	and climb up the
2139725	and that's how we get to the
2139728	the Super_babies got into their super buggy and off we zoomed
2139729	goo goo ga ga
2139732	that's right
2139734	first we needed to find the bubble bath
2139735	the Super_babies used their super hearing to hear the bubbles all the way down the road
2139737	pop pop pop
2139738	that's right
2139739	who's that
2139742	yes

2139757	right
2139758	let's have a look
2139760	okay
2139762	but when we tried to follow the road we found something blocking it
2139763	a big blue baby bear who was sound asleep
2139764	to wake up the big blue baby bear the Super_babies had to super cry
2139765	we help them
2139766	wah wah
2139768	they're crying aren't they
2139769	to wake up the blue bear aren't they
2139771	the blue bear
2139773	the super crying worked
2139774	the big blue baby bear woke up and stepped out of the way so we could make it to the bubble bath
2139775	but how could we get across
2139776	how they gonna get across the bubble bath Helen
2139778	use the what
2139780	the baby boat
2139781	hold on
2139782	haven't even turned that page yet
2139784	the Super_babies knew the answer
2139786	they would use their super blowing to blow the boat so we could paddle across
2139788	paddle
2139789	there were so many bubbles in the bubble bath
2139790	and they were really big
2139791	we needed to super pop the bubbles with our fingers
2139792	pop pop pop
2139794	it does
2139796	clever girl
2139798	an x-ray means um
2139799	it's something that you
2139800	it's like a special camera that can see your bones or see through things
2139802	mhm
2139804	yeah
2139805	it is isn't it
2139807	after crossing the bubble bath we needed to find the building blocks
2139808	but we couldn't see them
2139809	so the Super_babies used their super x-ray vision to see the building blocks through a rock
2139811	when we got to the building blocks we had to find a way to get up to the cliff
2139812	we needed to use the blocks to make steps
2139813	the blocks were too heavy for boots and me to lift
2139814	goo goo ga ga
2139815	what they doing Helen
2139817	they are
2139818	they're lifting those blocks up aren't they
2139820	but the Super_babies could do it
2139821	they super lifted the building blocks and made five super steps
2139822	we counted in Spanish as we climbed to the top
2139823	can you count in Spanish

2139842	just like your stickers for your Dora easel
2139844	we made it over the building blocks
2139845	but where were the bananas
2139846	the Super_babies used their super strength to lift us high and higher
2139847	until we could see the bananas
2139848	the Super_babies then had to super fly us to the bananas
2139849	but soon the babies got tired
2139850	they were thirsty
2139851	we needed some bottles
2139852	where could we get some bottles

2141290	NA
2141292	we don't make Play_Doh here do we
2141294	I don't I think it's quite easy to make
2141295	I think I've seen people making it
2141297	I don't know
2141298	I can't make it
2141299	I don't know ???
2141301	no let's see what we can make in this one
2141302	sandy s
2141303	oh

2141318	what do you have to do

2141326	um I think you just need to throw the things in
2141327	ah that's what it is
2141328	I think you th you've got to throw the balls into the pots
2141329	so I think you get more points if you get them into the smaller pots
2141331	then you don't get as many points
2141332	so maybe you get one point if you get them in the big pots
2141333	two points if you get them in the medium sized pots
2141334	and three points if you get them in the small pots

2152162	it's up to you darling
2152164	do the fox
2152165	okay
2152166	so right
2152167	you have to listen carefully when I read it then
2152168	okay
2152169	it says
2152170	foxes often appear in fairy tales as sly smart creatures
2152171	as hunters they have to be very clever to survive
2152172	so this is another example of an animal myth which is true
2152173	so
2152174	a fox is sly and cunning
2152175	are they sly and clever
2152177	is it true or false
2152179	no
2152180	it's not Helen
2152181	you didn't listen
2152182	listen
2152183	foxes often appear
2152185	so which one is it
2152187	you need to listen to what I say
2152188	and then you have to answer the question don't you
2152190	NA
2152191	what's your hair doing there
2152192	do you want to do the monkey one
2152195	the elephant one
2152196	okay
2152197	okay
2152198	it says
2152199	elephants never forget
2152200	this saying has been proved true by scientists
2152201	female elephants are good at recognizing friendly faces
2152202	then they let their herd know if an outsider is a friend or an enemy
2152203	their memories also get even better as they get older
2152204	so that is
2152206	true
2152207	that's right
2152209	NA
2152211	yeah
2152212	the question's actually elephants never forget
2152213	and that's true isn't it
2152215	they don't forget
2152218	that's about cats and dogs
2152220	it says
2152221	cats and dogs always fight
2152222	is that true or false
2152223	so
2152224	shall we find out of they always fight
2152225	it says
2152226	cats and dogs are seen as enemies
2152227	but that's not always the case
2152228	they can get on very well
2152229	especially if they grow up together
2152230	in fact they can get on better with each other than cats do with their own
2152231	so that is +..?
2152232	true
2152234	no no no
2152235	sorry
2152236	no
2152237	no
2152238	sorry it's false
2152239	cats and dogs always fight is false

2152242	they can be good friends can't they

2152255	the monkey one
2152256	okay

2152263	monkeys are completely crazy for bananas
2152264	they are found living in banana trees
2152265	so they are never short of this tasty snack

2154480	there will be no cauliflower or cabbage or baked beans or bananas or oranges
2154481	we don't have any apples or rice or cheese or fish+fingers and certainly no tomatoes
2154482	Lola looks at the table
2154483	but why are those carrots there Charlie
2154486	I don't know
2154487	it's funny that isn't it
2154489	why do you think
2154491	the carrots are there
2154493	you don't know
2154494	and I said oh you think these are carrots
2154495	these are not carrots
2154496	these are orange Twiglets from Jupiter
2154498	but how can they be carrots I say
2154499	carrots don't grow on Jupiter
2154500	that's true says Lola
2154501	well I might just try one if they're all the way from Jupiter
2154502	mm
2154503	not bad she says taking another bite
2154504	NA
2154505	wow
2154506	they're not carrots are they
2154509	that's right
2154510	that's earth isn't it
2154512	and this must be Jupiter
2154515	that's another planet
2154517	I don't know what planet that is
2154519	then Lola see some peas
2154520	I don't eat peas says Lola
2154521	I say these are not peas
2154522	of course they are not
2154523	these are green drops from Greenland
2154524	they are made out of green and fall from the sky
2154526	but I don't eat green things Lola says
2154527	look
2154528	there's a face on that pea isn't there
2154530	oh goody I say
2154531	I'll have your share
2154532	green drops are so incredibly rare
2154533	well maybe I'll nibble just one or two
2154534	oh says Lola
2154535	quite tasty
2154536	next Lola spies a potato
2154537	I will not eat potato so don't even try
2154538	not even mash
2154539	oh this isn't mash
2154540	people often think that but no this is cloud fluff from the pointiest point of Mount_Fuji
2154541	oh well in that case a large helping for me
2154542	I love to eat cloud
2154545	cloud
2154547	he's saying that the mashed potato is from is part of the cloud isn't he
2154550	Charlie she says they look like fish+fingers to me
2154551	and I would never eat a fish+finger
2154553	I know that
2154554	but these are not fish+fingers
2154555	these are ocean nibbles from the supermarket
2154556	under the sea mermaids eat them all the time
2154557	oh I've been to that supermarket one time with Mum
2154558	yes I know the ones
2154559	I think I've had them before Lola say gobbling
2154560	are there any more
2154561	and the Lola says Charlie will you pass me one of those
2154562	and I say what one of these
2154563	and Lola says yes Charlie one of those
2154564	and I can't believe my eyes
2154565	because guess what she's pointing at
2154567	and I say are you sure
2154568	really
2154569	one of these
2154570	and she says yes of course
2154571	moon squirters are my favorite
2154572	you don't think they were tomatoes did you Charlie
2154573	that's funny isn't it
2154576	so they pretend that all the food are something else don't they
2154578	and then she eats it all up doesn't she
2154581	mhm
2154583	yeah
2154584	I think they are really but I think her brother was trying to trick her wasn't he
2154586	and pretend that they were something else so that she would eat them

2161946	right
2161947	did you choose it or did you get given it
2161949	you got given it
2161951	who gave it to you
2161953	oh

2161961	hm

2161964	you know why I didn't get to come with you Helen don't you
2161966	yes
2161967	that's right
2161968	cause you can't go when there's animals around
2161969	when you're pregnant can you
2161970	because the thing is
2161972	no
2161973	but they might jump on you and
2161974	but also there's lots of things that can make Mummys um
2161975	Mummys that have babies in their tummy can get sick a lot quicker
2161976	than everybody else
2161977	so they can't really be around animals cause animals might make them poorly sick
2161978	and then the baby gets poorly sick and that's not good when babies get when tiny babies get poorly sick
2161979	you see
2161980	so that's why Mummys can't really go
2161983	yeah
2161985	yes
2161986	that's right
2161989	I think he's asleep at the moment

2161991	it's kicking lots today
2161993	yeah
2161994	he was excited about having something to eat
2161996	maybe the baby was excited about having something to eat
2161997	do you think it was
2161999	mhm
2162000	and
2162002	do you know what
2162003	I went to the I went to see the doctor today
2162005	and the doctor listened to the baby's heartbeat
2162007	well you need a special machine
2162008	and it
2162010	no
2162011	it just listens
2162012	it puts you put it on you put it on my tummy
2162014	and then you can hear the baby's heartbeat
2162016	yes

2170337	so do you still want me to read it
2170339	okay then
2170340	it was a lovely sunny day but the animals in the forest were paying no attention to the weather
2170341	they were arguing about which of them could run the fastest
2170342	Hare as usual was boasting .
2170343	I am the fastest by far .
2170344	I will race any of you .
2170345	the prize will be the ??? squirrel .
2170346	how about you ?
2170347	no fear not I giggled Squirral

2170351	Badger Hedgehog Weasel nobody
2170352	uh
2170353	nobody wants to race him do they

2170358	he's showing off a bit isn't he this hare
2170361	hm
2170362	hm
2170363	there was silence for a minute or two then a tiny voice said I'll have a try if you like
2170364	Hare turned round and saw Tortoise plodding slowly across the field at the edge of the forest
2170365	Hare giggled quietly to himself and tried to keep his face straight as he spoke to Tortoise
2170366	ah Tortoise so you are here at last
2170367	I saw no reason to hurry said Tortoise
2170368	it's such a lovely day after all
2170369	it seems that you are my only challenger
2170370	are you willing to race me to the stone bridge on the other side of the forest for this fine prize
2170371	it certainly is a fine prize
2170372	and a race to the bridge sounds fair enough
2170373	yes I am willing to race you said Tortoise slowly and carefully
2170374	here he comes look
2170375	coming through the fence isn't he
2170376	oh slow coach laughed Hare
2170377	you must be joking
2170378	you have no chance of beating me
2170379	the other animals joined in the laughter but Tortoise shock his head slowly
2170380	indeed I am not joking he said
2170381	now who is going to start us off
2170382	Hare was still laughing when the two animals lined up and waited for Owl's starting signal
2170383	oh
2170384	it's an owl isn't it
2170385	and we were just looking at owls weren't we in your magazine
2170386	I'm not finished yet
2170388	what's he gonna say
2170392	what what do owls say
2170393	twittawoo
2170396	there you go
2170397	the tawoo had hardly left Owl's beak when Hare was off like the wind speeding through the trees
2170398	Tortoise was still plodding into the edge of the woods when Hare was out of sight
2170399	come on Tortoise cheered the other animals laughing
2170400	can't you go faster than that
2170401	I don't know why you bother said Badger
2170402	Hare will win by miles said Hedgehog
2170403	Tortoise did not show that he was hurt by these unkind remarks instead he just kept plodding on
2170404	all the time saying to himself slow and steady wins the race
2170405	slow and steady wins the race
2170406	Hare charged relentlessly through the woods
2170407	he looked back but there was no sign of Tortoise so he lolloped on for a few more minutes and then stopped again
2170408	he was now at the far edge of the wood and in front of him he could see the old stone bridge the finishing post of the race
2170409	turn the page Helen
2170411	hm
2170413	oh
2170414	tell me what you can see then
2170416	yeah
2170417	racing through the forest
2170418	what else can you see
2170420	mushrooms
2170422	is he having a snooze now
2170425	oh yes
2170426	Hare being a bit of a show off did not like the idea of finishing with no one there to cheer him
2170427	so he sat down under a tree to wait until the other animals caught up
2170428	then he would make a triumphant dash for the bridge
2170429	it was a hot day however and Hare had to close his eyes against the glare of the sun
2170430	in the twinkling of an eye he had dozed off to sleep
2170431	it was late afternoon when Hare woke up and the sun was no longer fierce and hot
2170432	as he got up he heard the other animals in a state of excitement twittering squeaking and hooting
2170433	goody he thought they're here to see me win
2170434	poor old Tortoise he'll be miles behind
2170436	is he not
2170438	where is he
2170440	uh
2170441	Hare had a little stretch and got ready to run again
2170442	he did not know however that all the time he'd been sleeping Tortoise had been trudging slowly but steadily on through the woods
2170443	in fact Hare had been asleep long enough for Tortoise to catch up with him and pass him
2170444	and he did not realize that the other animals were cheering Tortoise and not him
2170445	Tortoise was now only a couple of steps away from the old stone bridge
2170446	all of a sudden Hare caught sight of Tortoise and with horror realized what had happened
2170447	he could not believe how foolish he had been
2170448	it did not matter how hard he ran for it was too late to catch up with Tortoise
2170449	and all the animals were there to see Tortoise win
2170450	Tortoise plodded the last steps to the bridge and stood there glowing with pride
2170451	it was one of the happiest days of his life
2170452	he had beaten Hare and the other animals cheered him
2170453	good old Tortoise you've won well done
2170454	poor Hare
2170455	how silly he felt to think of everybody watching him sleeping as Tortiose passed him
2170456	he wished he had never boasted
2170457	here you are
2170458	here's the gold button prize he muted with his ears drooping and well done
2170459	you can keep the button Hare Tortoise said kindly
2170460	I've had a lot of fun today
