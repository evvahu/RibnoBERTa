2086646	but Stingo had already rushed up on the stage to drag Slugsy off
2086647	Stingo slipped on Slugsy's slime and crashed into his friend
2086648	the pair got tangled up and rolled off the stage
2086649	they landed in the big cake that was first prize
2086650	everyone laughed and clapped
2086651	they're such a pair of clowns chuckled Aunt_Tulip in delight
2086652	we should give them first prize giggled Fifi they've got it all over them anyway
2086653	by the way asked Primrose what is a slug's favorite drink
2086654	slimeade said Slugsy through a faceful of icing
2086656	slimeade

2098035	no
2098036	okay
2098038	right
2098039	okay then
2098041	okay
2098043	I can start now can I
2098044	right
2098045	it says once there was a little girl called Sophie
2098047	??? yeah
2098048	her name's Sophie isn't it
2098050	what's up Louise
2098052	she is called Sophie
2098053	her name is Sophie
2098055	I don't know
2098056	we'll have to see if we can find out in the story won't we
2098058	and she was having tea with her mummy in the kitchen
2098059	suddenly there was a ring at the door
2098060	ding dong
2098061	Sophie's mummy said I wonder who that can be
2098064	that's right
2098065	it can't be the milkman because he came this morning
2098066	and it can't be the boy from the grocer because this isn't the day that he comes
2098068	and it can't be Daddy because he's got his key
2098069	we'd better open the door and see
2098071	NA
2098072	Sophie opened the door and there was a big furry stripy tiger
2098074	NA
2098075	is she hiding
2098077	cause she's scared
2098079	no
2098080	it's not real
2098081	it's only a story
2098083	it's only a picture
2098084	you can come out and your Mummy will look after you
2098087	is she alright now
2098090	oh okay then
2098092	okay
2098093	excuse me but I'm very hungry
2098094	do you think I could have tea with you
2098095	Sophie's Mummy said of course
2098096	come in
2098097	so the tiger came into the kitchen and sat down at the table
2098098	what do you think we should do if a tiger came to our house
2098102	do you not think we should let a tiger in our house
2098104	no
2098105	Sophie's Mummy said would you like a sandwich
2098106	but the tiger didn't just take one sandwich
2098107	he took all the sandwiches on the plate
2098109	and swallowed them in one big mouthful
2098111	NA
2098112	and he still looked hungry
2098113	so Sophie passed him the buns
2098114	but again the tiger didn't eat just one bun
2098115	he ate all the buns on the dish
2098116	and then he ate all the biscuits
2098117	and all the cake
2098118	until there was nothing left to eat on the table
2098119	so Sophie's Mummy said would you like a drink
2098120	and the tiger drank all the milk in the milk jug
2098121	and all the tea in the teapot
2098123	how cheeky
2098124	that's a bit greedy that isn't it
2098126	and then he looked around the kitchen to see what else
2098129	no
2098130	that's not really food is it
2098131	a brush
2098134	he ate all the supper that was cooking in the saucepans
2098135	and all the food in the fridge
2098136	and all the packets and tins in the cupboard
2098138	that's a bit rude isn't it
2098140	no
2098141	and he drank all the milk and all the orange juice and all Daddy's beer
2098142	and all the water in the tap
2098144	that's a very greedy tiger isn't it
2098146	then he said thank you for my nice tea
2098147	I think I'd better go now
2098148	and he went
2098149	Sophie's Mummy said I just don't know what to do
2098150	I've got nothing for Daddy's supper
2098151	the tiger has eaten it all
2098152	and Sophie found she couldn't have her bath because the tiger had drunk all the water in the tap
2098153	just then Sophie's Daddy came home
2098156	she will won't she
2098157	she'll be all dirty and yucky and sticky
2098158	urgh
2098160	so Sophie and her Mummy told him what had happened
2098161	and how the tiger had eaten all the food and eaten all the drink
2098162	and Sophie's Daddy said I know what we'll do
2098163	I've got a very good idea
2098164	we'll put on our coats and go to a cafe
2098165	so they went
2098167	yeah
2098168	they can then can't they
2098170	do you think so
2098173	it's gone small has it
2098175	and so they went out in the dark and all the street lamps were lit
2098176	and all the cars had their lights on
2098177	and they walked down the road to a cafe
2098178	and they had a lovely supper with sausages and chips and ice cream
2098179	in the morning Sophie and her Mummy went shopping and they bought lots more things to eat
2098180	and they also bought a very big tin of tiger food
2098181	in case the tiger should come to tea again
2098182	but he never did
2098183	that's a good job isn't it
2098185	that says goodbye goodbye goodbye
2098187	that's right
2098188	that's what it says
2098190	I don't know
2098191	cause he's saying goodbye
2098193	it says track one
2098194	sound effects
2098195	track two
2098196	toned for read along

2112230	you look nice with those clips in your hair Helen
2112232	???
2112233	shall we buy you some more
2112234	it'll keep your hair out of your eyes as well won't it

2112259	one looks like a bobble and one looks straight
2112262	yeah
2112263	it's cause their different bobbles aren't they
2112264	one's like a slide and ones like a clip
2112265	you need to have bobbles that are the same
2112266	really

2112269	yeah
2112270	do you think we should go and buy you some bobbles
