1017565	shall we put a yellow one on the top
1017567	shall I put you on the top
1017568	then can we throw you across the room

1017584	bash it
1017585	hey
1017587	of course
1017590	it's more exciting if you have a big tower I think to bash it
1017593	you build a really tall tower
1017594	find some more bricks and build a tall tower
1017595	then bash it
1017597	who's that

1019553	yes he's he's I think he's the one that s supposed to go in there

1019556	can't see over the dashboard
1019558	that's a panda
1019567	yes the trailer doesn't fit onto the car though does it
1019568	you need a special car for the trailer to fit on
1019572	oh yes
1019573	whose hat's that
1019575	whose hat is it
1019577	it's not Warren's hat
1019579	I'm sure you can borrow it
1019581	is it too big
1019582	Mummy make it not feel so big
1019583	look
1019586	what's in there
1019587	go and look at yourself
1019588	go and look at yourself in the television
1019589	see what you look like
1019591	what've you got on
1019593	what color hat
1019594	what color is it
1019597	yes Daddy does wear a hat like that on his bike
1019599	no you don't need your bike
1019600	you don't need your bike
1019601	you'll squash all Anna's toys if you bring your bike in here
1019602	won't you
1019603	but that is like a bike hat isn't it
1019604	when you're a bigger boy and ride your bike in the streets you'll have one
1019605	and if when you're a grown up man you work on building site you'll have_to wear one when you go to work
1019606	because these are good hats for protecting your head
1019607	in_case bricks fall on your head
1019608	or breeze blocks
1019609	or lumps of concrete from cranes
1019611	yeah the man the men working with cranes always have them
1019612	the men over the road all wear hard hats don't they
1019613	just like that one
1019614	except only one of them probably says big boss on the front
1019617	what are you making
1019622	has that come off the hat somewhere
1019623	can I see where it's come from
1019624	it's only a tiny bit
1019625	go and put it in the bin

1019627	this bin's closer
1019629	well you've not really broken the hat
1019630	it just fell off
1019632	well it's not broken
1019633	it's just a little tiny bit that's come off
1019634	I think it's come off from there
1019635	I can see where it's from
1019636	it's come off from there
1019638	you put the hat back on
1019640	pardon
1019642	yeah
1019643	you've got it on crooked
1019644	let's put it on straight
1019645	that's better
1019648	where's the car
1019650	Warren's not going in the car today
1019652	and you're not going in Granddad's car today either
1019653	but one day Granddad will come and collect you in his car

1019656	won't that be nice
1019658	pardon
1019661	well you haven't broken it
1019663	so what are you making on this board
1019664	I'd forgotten how this monkey goes on
1019665	he needs to go like that
1019666	what's the monkey doing
1019668	oh pulled them all off
1019669	what's that monkey saying
1019670	what does a monkey what do monkeys say
1019672	what do monkeys say

1019681	okay put it on then
1019684	whose car
1019689	oh
1019690	is there anybody in
1019691	is anyone in

1019706	is that what you were worried about
1019708	mind you
1019709	your Nana's driving is another thing altogether isn't it
1019711	you be careful
1019712	because look
1019713	you see you're squashing the board and there was a brick under it
1019714	and then you might break it
1019715	you have_to keep the board flat when you're pressing on it
1019716	and then you can't break it
1019717	when it's flat you can press things on nicely
1019718	what

1019722	what animal is that
1019723	what is it

1021082	Warren
1021083	look at the shape here
1021084	and look at the hole

1021109	just swing it round
1021110	that's it
1021111	that's a difficult one isn't it

1021250	it's still the wrong way
1021252	yeah it was the wrong way
1021253	that's still the wrong way
1021254	you have_to make it thin like that
1021255	that's it
1021256	why won't it go through

1021278	it goes in that one
1021279	the one you tried fits
1021280	if you hold it the right way round it'll go in
1021281	that's it
1021282	brilliant
1021284	there's no more red ones and there's no more triangles
1021285	you'll have_to put a yellow one or a blue one in

1021297	that's it
1021301	it is the wrong way
1021302	it won't fit in

1021469	don't bash the horse
1021470	gorillas don't bash horses
1021471	gorillas don't often bash anything actually
1021472	look
1021473	the gorillas riding the horse
1021474	whee
1021475	I didn't realize the gorilla fitted on there
1021476	that's quite good isn't it
1021477	he's a very happy gorilla isn't he
1021478	well if that was a real horse it'd be fairly squashed
1021481	never mind
1021482	we saw some gorillas didn't we when we were on holiday
1021484	we did
1021486	what else did we see
1021488	and what do tigers say
1021490	what else did we see
1021492	we saw elephants didn't we
1021496	oh look
1021497	the gorilla's lifting up the horse isn't it
1021498	if you put that down on the ground it looks as though gorilla s lifting it up
1021499	because gorillas are very strong
1021500	very very strong
1021502	where's the cow gone
1021503	oh it's there under your bottom
1021504	poor thing

1021519	it's not a very good place for the horse to sleep is it
1021520	it's the middle of the road
1021522	that's better isn't it
1021524	no
1021525	poor horse
1021527	if the horse was bashed by a mini car it'd be more than sleeping
1021528	poor thing
1021530	put it back in the field
1021531	put it back in the field with the cows
1021534	that's it
1021535	you put it in there
1021536	it's a much nicer place for the horse to be in
1021537	whoops
1021541	it is
1021549	where's the monkey being taken
1021550	he's waving isn't he

1021560	oh
1021562	brilliant
1021563	oh dear
1021564	if we put the cow in that way it fits better
1021565	there we go
1021566	is the gorilla waving byebye to the cow
1021567	byebye cow
1021572	oh yes
1021576	I don't think it'll join onto it actually
