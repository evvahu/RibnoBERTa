1766938	just ignore him
1766939	that's the best thing
1766941	did you put your play dough away
1766944	are ya
1766945	but do it in the wood bit
1766946	that's what you do
1766948	ya do
1766949	you put it inside the wood bit
1766950	that on there

1766964	don't know
1766965	you'll have to try it
1766966	that's the thing with jigsaws
1766967	I think it goes in one of the corners
1766968	it just depends which way the picture goes round
1766969	when you get a few more pieces in then you'll know which is which
1766971	yeah

1766973	oh those two are right
1766974	but that one doesn't go there
1766975	this looks like it might be the roof
1766976	like that
1766977	so maybe this one goes like
1766978	that's next door like that one
1766979	so see if you get any more red bits to go on top of this one and next to that one

1949439	we shall have to wait for you to get thin again
1949440	how long does getting thin take asked Pooh anxiously

1949442	a week said Pooh glumly
1949443	what about meals

1949445	cause getting thin quicker
1949446	but we will read to you
1949447	Pooh began to sigh and then found he couldn't because he was so tightly stuck
1949448	then would you read a sustained book such as would help and comfort a wedged bear in great tightness
1949449	so for a week Christopher_Robin read that sort of book at the north end of Pooh
1949450	and Rabbit hung washing on the south end
1949451	and in between Pooh felt himself getting slenderer and slenderer
1949452	and at the end of the week Christopher_Robin said now
1949453	so he took hold of Pooh's front paws and Rabbit took hold of Christopher_Robin and all Rabbit's friend and relations took hold of Rabbit
1949454	the all pulled together

1949459	it's this one
1949460	this one is
1949461	do you want me to read this one as well
1949463	this is called Pooh and the bees
1949465	it's like this Pooh said
1949466	when you go after honey with a balloon the great thing is not to let the bees know you're coming
1949467	wouldn't they notice you underneath the balloon Christopher_Robin asked
1949468	they might or they might not said Winnie_the_Pooh
1949469	you never can tell with bees
1949470	he thought for a moment and said I shall try to look like a small black cloud
1949471	that will deceive them
1949472	so Winnie_the_Pooh went to a very muddy place that he knew of and rolled and rolled until he was black all over
1949473	and then when the balloon was blown up as big as big Christopher_Robin let go of the string and Pooh_Bear floated gracefully up into the sky
1949474	there was no wind to blow him nearer to the tree so there he stayed
1949475	he could see the honey he could smell the honey but he couldn't quite reach the honey
1949476	Christopher_Robin Pooh said in a loud whisper
1949477	I think the bees suspect something
1949478	perhaps they think you're after their honey said Christopher_Robin
1949479	it may be that said Pooh
1949480	you never can tell with bees
1949481	so that's that one
1949482	are you putting all the secret notes away now
1949484	no

1982169	one afternoon Snow_White went to visit the dwarfs at their cottage
1982170	as usual she took them gifts and looked after them when they were there
1982171	as the dwarfs waved her goodbye Happy said Snow_White always makes us feel special
1982172	Grumpy agreed
1982173	let's do something special for her he suggested
1982174	let's pamper her said Doc
1982175	the other dwarfs thought this was a lovely idea
1982176	first they set up a throne
1982177	the next morning before the sun rose the dwarfs left a trail of petals from the throne to the gate of Snow_White's palace
1982178	that's what they're doing
1982179	they're laying petals
1982180	they're flower petals
1982181	very pretty isn't it
1982185	they're gonna lead to Snow_White's palace

1982188	well she
1982189	see
1982190	she's standing at her palace and she can see all the petals now can't she
1982191	when Snow_White awoke and looked from her balcony she saw the petal path
1982192	I wonder where it leads she thought
1982193	Snow_White followed the path until it reached the throne
1982194	surprise the dwarfs cheered
1982195	prepare to be pampered
1982196	as Snow_White sat down two squirrels hopped on to the throne and polished her nails
1982197	thank you Snow_White smiled
1982200	what
1982202	yeah
1982203	they're two squirrels and what they're doing is they're they're they're cleaning her nails with their tails

1982225	he's just being cross
1982227	oh
1982229	you're just being sad
1982230	then Dopey tipped a bucket of petals into a press
1982231	Grumpy squeezed them until their sweet smelling perfume had filled a bottle

1982261	I'm baking your Princess_fruit_pastry
1982263	oh

1982265	next Bashful presented Snow_White with a gold tiara with a lace veil
1982266	we made it ourselves added Doc
1982267	but just as Snow_White was about to place tiara on her head the wind became fierce and blew it right out of her hand
1982268	the wind became stronger
1982269	it tipped over the perfume blew out Grampy Grumpy's fire and scattered the path with petals
1982270	all our efforts have been ruined cried Happy
1982271	as quickly as it had started the wind died away
1982272	no one noticed that the petals were settling to make a new petal path through the forest
1982274	Grumpy groaned as he lit the fire
1982275	no we're not not finished yet
1982276	not finished yet
1982277	Grumpy groaned as he lit the fire again
1982278	sorry Snow_White he said
1982279	the Princess pastry will take a little longer to cook now
1982280	the dwarfs were disappointed about how their pampering day had turned out
1982282	we wanted to give you a day when all your wished came true they sighed
1982284	just then the sound of galloping hooves filled the air
1982285	Snow_White gasped as Prince_Charming rode along the path of petals
1982286	okay
1982287	turn the page
1982289	I saw this trail of petals appear and I followed it Prine_charming said
1982290	Snow_White blushed with excitement
1982291	I also found this hanging on a branch he added
1982292	producing the lost tiara and placing it on Snow_white's head
1982294	hurray cheered the dwarfs
